# CFG intro to javascript kickstarter course project - My gaming site
As part of the course we were placed into groups based on our preferred topic, our group topic was food. Between us we decided to create a deliveroo style app, we started out by creating our own 
individual restaurant pages with the view of adding them to the delivery app. Unfortunately, we ran out of time so I created a basic delivery site that linked out to each of our restaurants. 
As I finished my restaurant site quite quickly I also took the opportunity to create some additional sites for some of the other available topics, namely gaming and teaching.
